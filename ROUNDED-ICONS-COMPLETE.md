# ✅ Rounded Icons - COMPLETE

## 🎨 What Was Done

I've created **rounded/circular versions** of your logo for all browser and app icons:

### Generated Icons
- ✅ **favicon.png** (32x32) - Browser tab icon
- ✅ **apple-touch-icon.png** (180x180) - iOS home screen icon
- ✅ **icon-192.png** (192x192) - PWA icon (small)
- ✅ **icon-512.png** (512x512) - PWA icon (large)

All icons are **perfectly circular** and generated from your `kulosaaren_yhteiskoulu_logo.jpeg`.

### Updated Files
- ✅ `client/index.html` - Now uses `favicon.png` and `apple-touch-icon.png`
- ✅ `public/manifest.json` - Updated to use the new PNG icons
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Added cache headers for all new icons
- ✅ Icons copied to both `client/public/` and `public/` folders

### Tools Created
- ✅ `generate-icons.js` - Automated icon generator using Sharp library
- ✅ `create-rounded-icons.html` - Manual browser-based icon generator (backup)

## 🚀 Deployment

All changes have been:
- ✅ Built successfully
- ✅ Committed to git
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Deploying to Vercel automatically

## 🎉 Result

After Vercel finishes deploying (2-3 minutes), you'll see:
- **Rounded favicon** in browser tabs
- **Rounded icon** when adding to iOS home screen
- **Rounded icon** in PWA installations
- **Rounded icon** in Android app drawer

The icons are now **perfectly circular** and will look professional on all platforms!

## 📱 How to Test

1. Visit https://ksykmaps.vercel.app
2. Look at the browser tab - you should see a round owl logo
3. On mobile, tap "Add to Home Screen" - the icon will be round
4. Clear browser cache if you still see the old square icon (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## 🔥 Firebase Buildings

Since you added the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to Vercel, the buildings should now be visible on the map after this deployment completes!

Check the map at https://ksykmaps.vercel.app - you should see all buildings rendered.
