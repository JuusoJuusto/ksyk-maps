🚨 IF YOU DON'T SEE IT:

Problem: "I only see 6 tabs, not 7!"
Solution: 
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache
- Close and reopen browser
- Make sure you're logged in as admin

Problem: "The tabs are cut off on my screen"
Solution:
- The tabs might wrap to a second row
- Scroll down slightly
- Or make your browser window wider

Problem: "I see an error when clicking Settings"
Solution:
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for red error messages
- Share the error message

Problem: "Settings tab is there but empty/loading forever"
Solution:
- Check if server is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure Firebase is connected
- Restart the server

🎉 ONCE YOU'RE IN SETTINGS:

You can customize:
✅ App colors (with color pickers!)
✅ App name and logo
✅ Text in English and Finnish
✅ Toggle features on/off
✅ Set contact information

All changes save to Firebase and apply to EVERYONE immediately!

💡 TIP: 
Start with the Branding tab - change the primary color to see 
the changes take effect across the entire app!

🔥 REMEMBER:
After clicking "Save Changes", the page will reload automatically
to apply your new settings. This is normal!

Still can't find it? 
1. Make sure you're at /admin (not /admin-login)
2. Make sure you're logged in (you should see your name in header)
3. Look for 7 tabs at the top
4. The last one says "Settings"
5. Click it!

That's it! The Settings tab is definitely there and working! 🎨
