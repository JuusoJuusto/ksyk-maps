EMAIL NOT ARRIVING? CHECK VERCEL LOGS:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: ksykmaps project
3. Click: "Logs" tab (top menu)
4. Filter by: "Functions"
5. Look for: POST /api/users

You'll see logs showing:
🚀 ========== SENDING EMAIL ==========
ENV CHECK:
  EMAIL_PASSWORD: SET or NOT SET

If it says "NOT SET" - the variable isn't in Vercel!

DOUBLE CHECK IN VERCEL:
Settings → Environment Variables → Should see:
- EMAIL_HOST
- EMAIL_PORT  
- EMAIL_USER
- EMAIL_PASSWORD

If missing, add them and REDEPLOY!

OR: The password might be in spam folder - check Gmail spam!
