EMAIL NOT WORKING? CHECK THIS:

1. ✅ Code is correct (email service works)
2. ❌ Environment variables NOT SET in Vercel

YOU MUST ADD TO VERCEL:
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
→ ksykmaps project
→ Settings
→ Environment Variables
→ Add these:

EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=JuusoJuusto112@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=vvzvffmzwbdibwrb

Then click "Redeploy" in Deployments tab!

Without these, emails will ONLY show in server logs, not actually send.
